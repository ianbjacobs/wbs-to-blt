# wbs-to-blt
Turns a data table from a WBS form until BLT data. In the initial version, targeting OpenSTV.

After generation of a BLT file, use [OpenSTV](https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv) (with an appropriate version of Python, e.g., 2.7) as follows:
<pre>
     python2.7 runElection.py MeekSTV results.blt  
</pre>
